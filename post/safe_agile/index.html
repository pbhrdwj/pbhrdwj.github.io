    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy roboto f5 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-100-l"><p>Back in 2003, when I was a novice, entry-level, software engineer, one of my initial projects was in the Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) space. As it was my first job, I was all gung-ho about the thought of building something new and perhaps too eager to learn and apply whatever little programming skills I had acquired so far.</p>
<p>But all my hopes were dashed, when I realized soon enough, that for enterprise projects like this, there was a huge time lag between project kick-off and the first line of code being written. After all there were plans that had to be formulated, processes that needed to be adhered to and pre development lifecycle phases that had to be completed. What made it even worse, was that things kept moving back and forth between requirements gathering and architectural design, because the client was not quite sure what they wanted to be built and our architects were not too sure how we could build whatever we were supposed to build.</p>
<p>This was my first encounter with the <strong>Water-fall-hell-ish</strong> software development methodology. Needless to say, for this project, my <strong>low level</strong> programming rubber never met the delivery road and I was left merely twiddling my thumbs.</p>
<p>Cut to two decades later and we have invariably swung to the other extreme.</p>
<p>For, in the current all pervasive <strong><em>Agile Software Development</em></strong> model, developers are expected to churn out high quality complex code, in an arbitrary timeline, through an assembly line of imprecisely divided user-stories, all the while marching silently to the arrhythmic beat of the scrum master&rsquo;s drum. The pointy-haired boss and the agile coach, meanwhile, look at all this from afar and marvel at the synchronicity of their creation.</p>
<p>Ok, I exaggerated a bit here, but given the way our industry is moving, such a scenario is certainly not in the realm of the impossible.</p>
<p>For example, look below at this modern day enterprise monstrosity -</p>
<p><img src="/images/safe_agile.png" alt="SAFe Agile" title="Scaled Agile Framework"></p>
<p>Between the streams, the guardrails, the train tracks and the runways you would be hard pressed to find the two most important roles, for which all of this exists in the first place - <strong><em>the lowly developer</em></strong> and the <strong><em>poor customer</em></strong>! And even though the twain never meet, enterprises somehow expect all these buzzwords to come together and magically solve all our software development woes.</p>
<p>In reality, all this creates is layers of stifling bureaucratic overhead and increased friction amongst various groups because of the large decision-making surface area and creates an illusion of busyness. There is lot of output in every layer, but very little net outcome, as everyone is focussed on the minutiae, missing the wood from the trees. A senior developer, for e.g, in such a model might find himself sucked into a lot of ad-hoc meetings, frequently switching-contexts and thereby significantly reducing his productivity and focus.</p>
<p><strong><em>But how on earth did we end up here?</em></strong></p>
<p>As it turns out, this path to enterprise software development hell, was indeed paved with noble intentions.
For the origins of the Agile movement, lie, in the beautiful <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manifesto for Agile Software Development</a> that was developed in 2001 and which, to this date, remains as relevant and revolutionary as it was back then. It&rsquo;s <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">core principles</a> were so commonsensical that most senior developers were drawn to it like a moth to a flame.</p>
<p>Some of the practices that emerged from it, especially around Extreme programming (XP) - <strong>TDD, pair-programming, continuous refactoring, continuous integration, small releases, collective code ownership, code katas</strong> etc - were simple and effective guidelines that helped developers organize their thought processes, unclutter their code bases and iteratively take small steps forward to their business goals.</p>
<p>And it was fairly successful.</p>
<p>Until a swarm of rapacious businessmen, pointy-haired bosses, consultants, scrum masters, trainers and coaches, co-opted the entire movement and created a dogmatic religion out of it with a whole bunch of rituals and ceremonies - <strong>Planning Poker, T-shirt sizing, Burn-down charts and Daily Standups</strong>. These manufactured (and somewhat pointless) activities soon subsumed the whole space and Agile suddenly transmogrified into a full fledged industry.</p>
<p>Of course, this state of affairs is not lost on anyone. There are industry thought-leaders and well-known voices of the engineering community, including the signatories of the original Manifesto, who are cognizant of this form of <strong><em>faux-agile</em></strong> and bemoan the disaster that it has led us to.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>Pragmatic</em></strong> Dave Thomas, for instance, talks about how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-BOSpxYJ9M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Agile is dead</a>, but we need the concept of agility to be resurrected -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve lost the word agile. Let’s try to hang on to agility. Let’s keep it meaningful, and let’s protect it from those who would take the soul of our ideas in order to sell it back to us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ron Jeffries, another manifesto signatory, wrote about how serious developers <a href="https://ronjeffries.com/articles/018-01ff/abandon-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">should abandon agile!</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Other than perhaps a self-chosen orientation to the ideas of Extreme Programming — as an idea space rather than a method — I really am coming to think that software developers of all stripes should have no adherence to any “Agile” method of any kind. As those methods manifest on the ground, they are far too commonly the enemy of good software development rather than its friend.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Robert &ldquo;Uncle Bob&rdquo; Martin called out how in the mad rush to keep moving forward, Scrums create <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hG4LH6P8Syk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1506" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long-term technical problems</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you go fast and you are focusing on getting stories done, and stories done, and stories done, and stories done … the code can ROT just as fast as you are moving. And so what happens after a year is that the rate begins to slow. Not because you’re working less hard – you’re putting in a hell of a lot of effort – it’s just that you cannot force the code to accept the next new feature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rich Hickey, who has a god-gifted knack of untangling knots in one&rsquo;s brain, <a href="https://youtu.be/kGlVcSMgtV4?t=1034" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gave a brilliant talk</a>, underlying some of this unwanted complexity that has crept into our lives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What kind of runner can run as fast as they possibly can from the very start of a race? Only somebody who runs really short races.<br>
But of course, we are programmers and we are smarter than runners, apparently, because we know how to fix that problem.<br>
We just fire the starting pistol every 100 yards and call it a new sprint.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The inimitable Erik Meijer, of course put it more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u0sNRO-QKQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">succinctly</a> -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Agile is a cancer that we have to eliminate from the industry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>None of this is to suggest that we do not need agility. Or closer business/engineering collaboration. Or software craftsmanship.</p>
<p>But this so called cynicism around agile stems from a desire to find a healthy middle ground, eliminate the unnecessary bloat, keep things simple and reclaim the joy of software development.</p>
<p>And hope, that this decade will be the decade of <strong><em>Agility</em></strong> and not any more of <strong><em>Agile</em></strong>.</p>
